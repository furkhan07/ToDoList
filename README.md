Kaam on

Kaam on is a modern to-do list application built using React.js. This project serves as a simple yet powerful task management tool, helping users organize their daily activities, set priorities, and stay on track.

Overview

Kaam on allows users to:

- Create and manage tasks: Add new tasks, edit existing ones, and remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- Prioritize tasks: Assign priority levels to tasks to focus on what's most important.
- Track progress: Mark tasks as completed and monitor your productivity.
- Filter and search tasks: Easily find tasks based on keywords or filter by status or priority.

Features

- React Hooks: Utilizes hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage component state and side effects.
- Component-based architecture: Each part of the to-do list (task input, task list, etc.) is built as a reusable component.
- State Management: Efficient state management using React's built-in tools.
- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Optional Backend Integration: The app can be easily extended to integrate with a backend for persistent data storage.
